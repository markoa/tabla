== Tabla

Tabla is a lightweight wiki built with Ruby on Rails.
It's still quite early in development.

The first time application runs without any user data,
it shows a 'Bootstrap' link allowing the first person
to log in and register with an OpenID.

For each new user somebody must create and give a new registration code.

The wiki is thus by default made to be used in closed groups,
but that can be tweaked easily.

== Syntax
