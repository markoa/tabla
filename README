== Tabla

Tabla is a lightweight wiki built with Ruby on Rails.
It's still quite early in development.

The first time application runs without any user data, it shows a 'Bootstrap' link allowing the first person to log in and register with an OpenID.
For each new user somebody must create and give a new registration code.
The wiki is thus made to be used in closed groups,
but that can be changed easily.
